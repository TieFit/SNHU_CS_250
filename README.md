1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs through the usage of user stories. User stories help by taking feedback and requirements from a user and then transforming it into an actionable task that can be accomplished. 

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Currently I approach programming by first clearly gathering the requirements and then doing a rough design of how the program logic will work before then writing the code. One Agile process I hope to incorporate into my future work is Agile's focus on delivering functional increments of a program.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development communicates well with their team and follows best practices when writing code. For example, leaving comments to explain the purpose of certain parts of their program and making sure that variable names are simple and logically named.
